## Summary
This project was the most entertaining one I've built to date! It was also challenging due to the way the the data is fetched from the API. I had to take time to understand how to contend with the asynchronous nature of HTTP requests while attempting to display all of the data to the user at the same time. I was also able to leverage hooks and other React features to improve the functionality of my program.
